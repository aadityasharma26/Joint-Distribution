Primary Goals:
🎯 Here are the primary goals we'll achieve in our joint distribution lesson:

🤝 Understanding joint probability mass function and joint cumulative distribution function and applying them to analyze the joint behavior of discrete random variables.

📈 Understanding joint probability density function and using it to analyze the joint behavior of continuous random variables.

🔍 Understanding marginal distribution and using it to study the behavior of a single random variable from a joint distribution.

🎯 Understanding conditional distribution and using it to examine the behavior of a random variable given that we have information about another random variable.

💞 Understanding covariance and correlation and using them to measure the relationship between two random variables in a joint distribution.

🌟 Understanding the multivariate normal distribution and using it to model the behavior of multiple random variables.

By achieving these goals, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of joint distribution and its applications in various fields. Let's get started on this exciting journey! 🚀
